# Theory of Algorithms Problems

A series of problems relating to theory of algorithms and computation.

## Problems

1. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that uses brute-force algorithm that takes a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and false otherwise.
 Call the function `decide-prime`.

2. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that takes a positive integer *n*<sub>0</sub> as input
and returns a list by recursively applying the following operation, starting with the
input number.

*n*<sub>i+1</sub> = 3*n*<sub>i</sub> + 1 if *n*<sub>i</sub> is odd
*n*<sub>i+1</sub> = *n*<sub>i</sub> รท 2

End the recursion when (or if) the number becomes 1. Call the function `collatz-list`.
So, collatz-list should return a list whose first element is *n*<sub>0</sub>, the second element
is *n*<sub>1</sub>, and so on. For example:

```
> (collatz-list 5)
'(5 16 8 4 2 1)

> (collatz-list 9)
'(9 28 14 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1)

> (collatz-list 2)
'(2 1)
```
